# MIDI - Madmapper, Ableton and More 

### MIDI Node/Arduino chart (you need this later) 
[https://diymidicontroller.com/midi-note-chart/ ]()


### View the code and Serial Monitor data

1. Find "MIDI-timed" on this Github page (open new tab)
- Upload
- Open Serial Monitor (Search icon right top)
- Your serial monitor will now be in the IDE, always open this when working with arduino

### View the MIDI communication 
1. Download MIDI View: [https://hautetechnique.com/midi/midiview/
](https://vimeo.com/753106105)
- Open MidiView 
- Click Enable, and Select Arduino Micro 
- You should be able to see the notes  de MidiView

### Generate MIDI using the distance sensor 
1. Copy/download/fork the code from:[MIDI-distance_NoteOn](https://github.com/harmsel/ImmersiveEnvironments/tree/main/MIDI-distance_NoteOn)
- Follow instructions in this code how to connect your Distance sensor
- Upload the code en check the data in the Serial Monitor (Arduino)  
- Check if data is received by MidiView  

## Control Madmapper with distance sensor (Arduino) 
1. Make two scenes (Dropdown: Scenes/ Cues 
2. Attach a MIDI controll to start each scene (dropdown: controll list) > Learn MIDI 
3. Go to Scenes/ Cues > select a scene 
4 Tigger a MIDI note ON (arduino) 
* Edit MIDI (in Control list)

ðŸ’¡ðŸš€TIP: If you want to test what switching between scenes looks like. Then use your keyboard to fake the interaction for testing. Then instead of MIDI, choose Keyboard 

# Make Ableton interactive - Using external sensors 
How it works: Sensor -> MICRO-> Seeeduino -> MIDI -> Ableton 

### Ableton MIDI settings 
1. Live > Preferences > Link/tempo/MIDI 
- in the 'MIDI ports' section:  
	- select Micro: Track and Remote

**Check if MIDI Is received by Ableton 
**
In the top, on the far right, two squares next to each other. You see the yellow block light up very briefly at MIDI input.

Code is a bit different from the code we use now
